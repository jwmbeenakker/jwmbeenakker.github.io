We embrace the Open Science movement to make research more transparent and share data as much as possible. 
This means our projects are reviewed and validated by our peers and our output, whether it is software, methods or data,  are made accessible to the benefit of other scientists, healthcare professionals and patients.

## Software

- [ZOSPy](https://github.com/MREYE-LUMC/ZOSPy) is our open source platform to perform **optical simulations** in Optic Studio and to share with other scientists through Jupyter notebooks
